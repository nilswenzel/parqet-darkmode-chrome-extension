![myImage](./docs/gifs/readme_images.gif)

<br/>

Darkmode for parqet.com as a Chrome Web Extension.

[German version](./docs/readme_ger.md)

<br/>

## Information
Since parqet has no darkmode yet, I’ve decided to create one myself. For examples check out the images. If you find a bug don’t hesitate to contact me and let me know.

The darkmode can be deactivated/activated at any time in the popup. Additionally you can decide whether the charts should be light or dark as well.
Have fun with it!

- tested on Mac/Windows
